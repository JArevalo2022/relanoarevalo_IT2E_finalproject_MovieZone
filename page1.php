      <p style="color: white; font-size: 20px; float: center; padding-left: 20px; margin-right: 950px;"> Your opinion on Sucker Punch will likely hinge on your opinion of Zack Snyder’s particular style.This steampunk fantasy delves into the imagination of Babydoll (Emily Browning), a young woman locked in an asylum who wages a war for freedom inside her mind alongside four other women.

      <p style="color: white; font-size: 20px; float: center; padding-left: 20px; margin-right: 950px;"> Tim Burton’s folksy fantasy is one that many of us can identify with. It’s the manifestation of an old man’s hyperbolic stories of his life. Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) has always told seemingly tall tales about his life as fact, a trait that has made his relationship with his son, William (Billy Crudup), difficult. But when Edward continues to tell these fantasy stories on his deathbed, William decides to finally investigate his father’s tales. As he does, he begins to finally understand his father after a lifetime of confusion.</p>

Regardless, Hiccup ventures out into battle and downs a mysterious Night Fury dragon with his invention, but can't bring himself to kill it.

But even as the two each take flight in their own way, they find that they must fight the destructive ignorance plaguing their world. </p>
